# Changelog

## 2026-07-09

- Stabilized the Swift app window lifecycle: closing the main window now hides it, and reopening the app brings the main page back.
- Added internal DMG packaging with `make package`.
- Switched app icon generation to the project-local `Assets/AppIcon/icon.png`.
- Cleaned project structure by removing the historical crash report from source control scope.
- Kept generated build artifacts such as `.build/` and `dist/` out of Git.
